## Uploading Data onto CyVerse

If you are interested in continuing working within the CyVerse environment with your own data, follow the instructions below to upload your data onto the server:

1. Choose the data panel on the left
2. Click the Folder button to create a new folder that will hold your reads
3. Navigate to the newly created folder
4. Click Upload then choose "Browse Local"
5. Select files on your computer to be uploaded then choose "Open"
7. Files will start uploading (this can take time if there are large files)
